# better-sqlite3-octodb [![Build Status](https://github.com/octodb/better-sqlite3/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/octodb/better-sqlite3/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

The fastest and simplest library for OctoDB/SQLite3 in Node.js.

- Full transaction support
- High performance, efficiency, and safety
- Easy-to-use synchronous API *(better concurrency than an asynchronous API... yes, you read that correctly)*
- Support for user-defined functions, aggregates, virtual tables, and extensions
- 64-bit integers *(invisible until you need them)*
- Worker thread support *(for large/slow queries)*

## How other libraries compare

> You can verify these results by [running the benchmark yourself](./docs/benchmark.md).

## Installation

```bash
npm install better-sqlite3-octodb
```

> You must be using Node.js v14.21.1 or above. Prebuilt binaries are available for [LTS versions](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/). If you have trouble installing, check the [troubleshooting guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Usage

```js
const options = { verbose: console.log };
const uri = 'file:test.db?node=secondary&connect=tcp://127.0.0.1:1234';
const db = require('better-sqlite3-octodb')(uri, options);

const timer = setInterval(function(){
  var res = db.prepare('PRAGMA sync_status').get();
  var status = JSON.parse(res.sync_status);
  if (status.db_is_ready) {
    clearInterval(timer);
    onDbReady();
  }
}, 1000);

function onDbReady() {

  const row = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?').get(userId);
  console.log(row.firstName, row.lastName, row.email);

  setTimeout(function(){
    console.log('closing...');
    db.close();
  }, 2000);

}
```

Though not required, [it is generally important to set the WAL pragma for performance reasons](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/blob/master/docs/performance.md).

```js
db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL');
```

##### In ES6 module notation:

```js
import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
const db = new Database('foobar.db', options);
db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL');
```

## Why should I use this instead of [node-sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)?

- `node-sqlite3` uses asynchronous APIs for tasks that are either CPU-bound or serialized. That's not only bad design, but it wastes tons of resources. It also causes [mutex thrashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_contention) which has devastating effects on performance.
- `node-sqlite3` exposes low-level (C language) memory management functions. `better-sqlite3` does it the JavaScript way, allowing the garbage collector to worry about memory management.
- `better-sqlite3` is simpler to use, and it provides nice utilities for some operations that are very difficult or impossible in `node-sqlite3`.
- `better-sqlite3` is much faster than `node-sqlite3` in most cases, and just as fast in all other cases.

#### When is this library not appropriate?

In most cases, if you're attempting something that cannot be reasonably accomplished with `better-sqlite3`, it probably cannot be reasonably accomplished with SQLite3 in general. For example, if you're executing queries that take one second to complete, and you expect to have many concurrent users executing those queries, no amount of asynchronicity will save you from SQLite3's serialized nature. Fortunately, SQLite3 is very *very* fast. With proper indexing, we've been able to achieve upward of 2000 queries per second with 5-way-joins in a 60 GB database, where each query was handling 5–50 kilobytes of real data.

If you have a performance problem, the most likely causes are inefficient queries, improper indexing, or a lack of [WAL mode](./docs/performance.md)—not `better-sqlite3` itself. However, there are some cases where `better-sqlite3` could be inappropriate:

- If you expect a high volume of concurrent reads each returning many megabytes of data (i.e., videos)
- If you expect a high volume of concurrent writes (i.e., a social media site)
- If your database's size is near the terabyte range

For these situations, you should probably use a full-fledged RDBMS such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
